Programmer Graeme Generated new fonts for GUI.
Programmer Graeme Converted TTF to C Array. 

The Friendship Cube Group: 
We aim to submit FriendshipCube to the Unicode graphics library.
We are inviting the "Friends of Unicode" to download & re-upload our fonts and C array code. 
We have designed some fonts for capturing lyrics and speech live.
We are working on real-time speech to text captioning with our custom cube fonts.
FriendshipCube features six symbols that rotate and combine.
The fonts feature a beautiful correlation between geometry and phonetics. 
I hope that the Friends of Unicode will allow me to adopt these six new character symbols that rotate and combine.

FriendshipCube has become a recognized global standard for digital communication.
You're invited to participate as a "Friend of Unicode".
